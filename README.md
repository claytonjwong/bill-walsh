-[Bill Walsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach))

Bill Walsh was a genius at making the complex comprehensible, the comprehensible achievable.  He held the need to treat individuals within his organization fairly almost sacrosanct (in return, those individuals were expected to consistently work at their most productive level).  It stemmed from his own professional experience of being treated unfairly, which he describes here in detail.

Bill Walsh loved lists, viewed them as a road map to results.  His creative and commonsense brilliance as a problem solver was unsurpassed and a major component in the installation of what he called the Standard of Performance.

## Prologue: To Succeed You Must Fail

Often we crash and fail, this is part and parcel of pursuing and achieving very ambitious goals.  Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called "failure."

A resolute and resourceful leader understands that there are a multitude of means to increase the *probability* of success: intelligently and relentlessly seeking solutions that will increase chance of prevailing in a competitive environment.

Pursuing your ambitions, especially those of any magnitude, can be grueling and hazardous, and produce agonizing failure along the way, but achieving those goals is among life's most gratifying and thrilling experiences.  The ability to survive and overcome the former to attain the latter is a fundamental difference between winners are losers.

Individuals who prevail have one thing in common besides success, it is failure - and their ability to overcome it.

## Part I: My Standard of Performance: An Environment of Excellence

There is a significant price to pay to be the best.  After failing, we must stand and fight again by re-focusing our thinking out of the past and move it forward to the next big problem.  It takes all our strength to shift our attention off the pain of failure.

When knocked down we must get back up.  When the inevitable setback, loss, failure, or defeat comes crashing down on us, allow some "grieving time," but then recognize that the road to recovery and victory lies in having the strength to get up off the mat and start planning our next move.

Failure is a part of success, an integral part.  Everyone gets knocked down.  Knowing it will happen and what we must do when it does is the first step back.  We must rise up again to stand and confront the future instead of wallowing in the past.  Many cannot summon the strength; they can't get up; their fight is over and victory goes to another, a stronger competitor.

When we stand and overcome a significant setback, we find an increasing inner confidence and self-assurance that has been created by conquering defeat.  Absorbing and overcoming this kind of punishment engenders a sober, steely thoughness that results in a hardened sense of independence and a personal belief that we can take on anything, survive and win.  The competitor who won't go away, who won't stay down, has one of the most formidable competitive advantages of all: to not go away, to get up and fight back.

### 5 Do's: Getting Back into the Game

1. Expect defeat
2. Stop looking backwards and dwelling on defeat
3. Allow appropriate recovery time from defeat
4. Tell yourself: "I am going ot stand and fight again" knowing that often when things are at their worse, you're closer than you can imagine to success
5. Begin planning for the next step: focus on the fix


### 5 Dont's

1. Don't ask "why me"
2. Don't expect sympathy
3. Don't bellyache
4. Don't keep accepting condolences
5. Don't blame others

### My Standard of Performance: High Requirements for Actions and Attitudes

Bill Walsh's standard of performance has more do to with the mental than the physical, organizational ethics are crucial to ultimate and ongoing success.

#### Fundamental Leadership Assertion

Regardless of our specific job, it is vital to the team that we do that job at the highest possible level in *all* its various aspects, both mental and physical (ie. good talent with bad attitude equals bad talent).

#### An Organization Has a Conscience

An organization is *not* just a tool like a shovel, but an organic entity that has a code of conduct which boils down to personal accountability amoung the organization.  The dictates of a leader's personal beliefs ultimately become characteristics of the team.  A leader must know what needs to be done and possess the capabilities and conviction to get it done.  Several factors affect this, but none is more important than the dictates of a leader's personal beliefs.  Collectively, they comprise a philosophy, and their philosophy is an aggregate of a leader's attitudes toward fundamental matters and is derived from a process of consciously thinking about critial issues and developing rational reasons for holding one particular belief or position rather than another.  It is a conceptual blueprint for action; that is, a perception of *what* should be done, *when* it should be done, and *why* it should be done.  A leader's philosophy is the single most important navigational point on their leadership compass.  A leader must exhibit the principles, code of conduct, and behavior they are asking others to emulate.

#### The Prime Directive Was Not Victory

Bill Walsh directed the team's focus less to the prize of victory than to the process of improving - obsessing, perhaps, about the quality of our execution and the content of our thinking, ie. our actions and attitudes (the bull-headed know-it-all is a destructive force on the team).

#### Top Priorities

The leader creates an organizational perception that "success belongs to everyone."  We are united and fight as one; we win or lose as one.  Combat soldiers talk about who they will die for.  Who is it?  It's the people right next to them in the trench.  That is the measure of any great organization, that willingness to sacrifice for the team, to go the extra mile.  Teammates demand and expect a lot of one another.  That's extremely important because when you know that your peers demand and expect a lot out of you and you, in turn, out of them, that's when the sky's the limit.

A leader's job is to facilitate a battlefield-like sense of camaraderie amoung their personnel, an environment for people to find a way to bond together, to care about one another and the work they do, to feel the connection and extension so necessary for great results.  Ultimately, it's strongest bond of all, even stronger than money.

#### Winners Act Like Winners (Before They're Winners)

Achieving success takes patience, time, and fortitude.  The commitment to, and execution of, the specific actions and attitudes embodied in Bill Walsh's standard of performance were crucial to creating and cementing a level of professionalism, a solid foundation upon which future success could be constructed.  There was no showboating allowed after a touchdown, no taunting of opponents, no demonstrations to attract attention to oneself, because one individual shouldn't take credit for what the whole team had done.  People want to believe they're part of something special, an organization that's exceptional.  The culture precedes positive results.  Champions behave like champions before they're champions; they have a winning standard of performance before they're winners.

#### Seek to Be Near the Summit

The standard of performance served as a compass that pointed to true north.  Consistent effort is a consistent challenge.  There's an ebb and flow, an up and down, in every significant endeavor at every level.  The high standards for actions and attitudes within Bill Walsh's organization never wavered - regardless of whether his team was winning or losing.

The key to performing under pressure at the highest possible level is preparation in the context of your standard of performance.  With that comes the knowledge that you can step into that high-pressure arena and go about your wor while the score works itself out.  With continual preparation via practice, we acquire the skills and proficiencies to work through extreme pressure and prevail.

## Part II: Success is not spelled GENIUS - Innovation, Planning, and Common Sense

Naysayers are often locked into the past and thus unwittingly locking themselves out of the future.  Bill Walsh invented "The West Coast Offense" and shared his lessons about it:

1. Success doesn't care which road you take to get to its doorstep
2. Be bold.  Remove feat of the unknown, ie. change from your mind
a. Respect the past without clinging to it
b. "That's the way we've always done it" is the mantra of a team setting itself up to lose
c. Innovators aren't afraid of change
3. Desperation shouldn't drive innovation
4. Be obsessive looking for the upside in the downside
a. continually seek solutions to succeed

### Share the Glory

Give ample credit to those working with us.  Few thing offer greater return on less investment than praise - offering credit to someone in your organization who has stepped up and done the job.

### Write Your Own Script for Success: Flying by the Seat of Your Pants (Is No Way to Travel)

Having a well-though out plan ready to go in advance of a change in the weather is the key to success.  Making decisions off the top of our heads is a recipe for making bad decisions because we aren't at our best under extreme stress.  We cannot think as clearly or perform as well when engulfed by stress, anxiety, fear, tension, or turmoil.

We must envision the future deeply and in detail, to creatively make the unforseeable foreseeable, and then write our script for the foreseeable.

Knowing what to do under every foreseeable circumstance helps to alleviate anxiety and uncertainty because of the preconceived "game plan."

Scripting provides a prepared, yet flexible method to navigate through turmoil, uncertainty, and stress.

Contigency scripting provides a well-thought-out basis for situational decision making and action; by analzying, planning, and rehearsing in advance you can make a rational decision, the best choice for the situation at hand.  Everything has to be strategized; we have to know where we're going to come out before we go in.  Otherwise we lose.  Scripting and strategizing are simply two different words for fair- and foul-weather leadership.  It brings clarity to confusion situations.

The military is known for doing this - war gaming, thinking through its response to all contingencies.  The more thorough, the more extensive, the more rehearsed, the better you perform under the pressure of any situation that calls for an immediate decision.

Planning for the future shouldn't be postponed until the future arrives.  Scripting allowed Bill Walsh to take randomness and stress out of the decision-making process.  The result was a very adaptable but intelligent plan for the future.

### Control What You Can Control: Let the Score Take Care of Itself

1. Flying by the seat of our pants precedes crashing by the seat of our pants
2. When we prepare for anything, we are ready for anything
3. Create a crisis-management team that is smart enough to anticipate and plan for crises
4. All personall must recognize the organization is adaptive and dynamic in facing unstable "weather"
5. Be resolute in our vision of the future and contingent plans to get where we want to go
6. Our version of "scripting" allows us to respond appropriately in a professional manner; we act like leaders

### The Archaeology of Leadership: Seek Reward in the Ruins

When an organization falls short of a goal, the letdown can be so severe we're blinded to substantive information indicating that success may be closer than we would imagine.

In hindsight, a commonsense mind can parse evidence that offers clues to why things went as they did - both good and bad.  In planning for a successful future, the past can show us how to get there.  Too often we avert our gaze when the past is unpleasant.  We don't want to go there again, even though it contains the road map to a bright future.

### Team Communication Matters

Bill Walsh was smart enough, strong-willed enough, to get rid of talented peope if they were contributors to a negative organizational culture - not team players.

Bill Walsh prized communication and understood that all the knowledge in the world meant little if we cannot communication effectively.
