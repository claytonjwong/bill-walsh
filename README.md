Bill Walsh was a genius at making the complex comprehensible, the comprehensible achievable.  He held the need to treat individuals within his organization fairly almost sacrosanct (in return, those individuals were expected to consistently work at their most productive level).

Bill Walsh loved lists, viewed them as a road map to results.  His creative and commonsense brilliance as a problem solver was unsurpassed and a major component in the installation of what he called the Standard of Performance.
