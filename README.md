-[Bill Walsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach))

Bill Walsh was a genius at making the complex comprehensible, the comprehensible achievable.  He held the need to treat individuals within his organization fairly almost sacrosanct (in return, those individuals were expected to consistently work at their most productive level).  It stemmed from his own professional experience of being treated unfairly, which he describes here in detail.

Bill Walsh loved lists, viewed them as a road map to results.  His creative and commonsense brilliance as a problem solver was unsurpassed and a major component in the installation of what he called the Standard of Performance.

## Prologue: To Succeed You Must Fail

Often we crash and fail, this is part and parcel of pursuing and achieving very ambitious goals.  Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called "failure."

A resolute and resourceful leader understands that there are a multitude of means to increase the *probability* of success: intelligently and relentlessly seeking solutions that will increase chance of prevailing in a competitive environment.

Pursuing your ambitions, especially those of any magnitude, can be grueling and hazardous, and produce agonizing failure along the way, but achieving those goals is among life's most gratifying and thrilling experiences.  The ability to survive and overcome the former to attain the latter is a fundamental difference between winners are losers.

Individuals who prevail have one thing in common besides success, it is failure - and their ability to overcome it.

## Part I: My Standard of Performance: An Environment of Excellence

There is a significant price to pay to be the best.  After failing, we must stand and fight again by re-focusing our thinking out of the past and move it forward to the next big problem.  It takes all our strength to shift our attention off the pain of failure.

When knocked down we must get back up.  When the inevitable setback, loss, failure, or defeat comes crashing down on us, allow some "grieving time," but then recognize that the road to recovery and victory lies in having the strength to get up off the mat and start planning our next move.

Failure is a part of success, an integral part.  Everyone gets knocked down.  Knowing it will happen and what we must do when it does is the first step back.  We must rise up again to stand and confront the future instead of wallowing in the past.  Many cannot summon the strength; they can't get up; their fight is over and victory goes to another, a stronger competitor.

When we stand and overcome a significant setback, we find an increasing inner confidence and self-assurance that has been created by conquering defeat.  Absorbing and overcoming this kind of punishment engenders a sober, steely thoughness that results in a hardened sense of independence and a personal belief that we can take on anything, survive and win.  The competitor who won't go away, who won't stay down, has one of the most formidable competitive advantages of all: to not go away, to get up and fight back.

### 5 Do's: Getting Back into the Game

1. Expect defeat
2. Stop looking backwards and dwelling on defeat
3. Allow appropriate recovery time from defeat
4. Tell yourself: "I am going to stand and fight again" knowing that often when things are at their worse, you're closer than you can imagine to success
5. Begin planning for the next step: focus on the fix


### 5 Dont's

1. Don't ask "why me"
2. Don't expect sympathy
3. Don't bellyache
4. Don't keep accepting condolences
5. Don't blame others

### My Standard of Performance: High Requirements for Actions and Attitudes

Bill Walsh's standard of performance has more do to with the mental than the physical, organizational ethics are crucial to ultimate and ongoing success.

#### Fundamental Leadership Assertion

Regardless of our specific job, it is vital to the team that we do that job at the highest possible level in *all* its various aspects, both mental and physical (ie. good talent with bad attitude equals bad talent).

#### An Organization Has a Conscience

An organization is *not* just a tool like a shovel, but an organic entity that has a code of conduct which boils down to personal accountability amoung the organization.  The dictates of a leader's personal beliefs ultimately become characteristics of the team.  A leader must know what needs to be done and possess the capabilities and conviction to get it done.  Several factors affect this, but none is more important than the dictates of a leader's personal beliefs.  Collectively, they comprise a philosophy, and their philosophy is an aggregate of a leader's attitudes toward fundamental matters and is derived from a process of consciously thinking about critial issues and developing rational reasons for holding one particular belief or position rather than another.  It is a conceptual blueprint for action; that is, a perception of *what* should be done, *when* it should be done, and *why* it should be done.  A leader's philosophy is the single most important navigational point on their leadership compass.  A leader must exhibit the principles, code of conduct, and behavior they are asking others to emulate.

#### The Prime Directive Was Not Victory

Bill Walsh directed the team's focus less to the prize of victory than to the process of improving - obsessing, perhaps, about the quality of our execution and the content of our thinking, ie. our actions and attitudes (the bull-headed know-it-all is a destructive force on the team).

#### Top Priorities

The leader creates an organizational perception that "success belongs to everyone."  We are united and fight as one; we win or lose as one.  Combat soldiers talk about who they will die for.  Who is it?  It's the people right next to them in the trench.  That is the measure of any great organization, that willingness to sacrifice for the team, to go the extra mile.  Teammates demand and expect a lot of one another.  That's extremely important because when you know that your peers demand and expect a lot out of you and you, in turn, out of them, that's when the sky's the limit.

A leader's job is to facilitate a battlefield-like sense of camaraderie amoung their personnel, an environment for people to find a way to bond together, to care about one another and the work they do, to feel the connection and extension so necessary for great results.  Ultimately, it's strongest bond of all, even stronger than money.

#### Winners Act Like Winners (Before They're Winners)

Achieving success takes patience, time, and fortitude.  The commitment to, and execution of, the specific actions and attitudes embodied in Bill Walsh's standard of performance were crucial to creating and cementing a level of professionalism, a solid foundation upon which future success could be constructed.  There was no showboating allowed after a touchdown, no taunting of opponents, no demonstrations to attract attention to oneself, because one individual shouldn't take credit for what the whole team had done.  People want to believe they're part of something special, an organization that's exceptional.  The culture precedes positive results.  Champions behave like champions before they're champions; they have a winning standard of performance before they're winners.

#### Seek to Be Near the Summit

The standard of performance served as a compass that pointed to true north.  Consistent effort is a consistent challenge.  There's an ebb and flow, an up and down, in every significant endeavor at every level.  The high standards for actions and attitudes within Bill Walsh's organization never wavered - regardless of whether his team was winning or losing.

The key to performing under pressure at the highest possible level is preparation in the context of your standard of performance.  With that comes the knowledge that you can step into that high-pressure arena and go about your wor while the score works itself out.  With continual preparation via practice, we acquire the skills and proficiencies to work through extreme pressure and prevail.

## Part II: Success is not spelled GENIUS - Innovation, Planning, and Common Sense

Naysayers are often locked into the past and thus unwittingly locking themselves out of the future.  Bill Walsh invented "The West Coast Offense" and shared his lessons about it:

1. Success doesn't care which road you take to get to its doorstep
2. Be bold.  Remove fear of the unknown, ie. change from your mind
a. Respect the past without clinging to it
b. "That's the way we've always done it" is the mantra of a team setting itself up to lose
c. Innovators aren't afraid of change
3. Desperation shouldn't drive innovation
4. Be obsessive looking for the upside in the downside
a. continually seek solutions to succeed

### Share the Glory

Give ample credit to those working with us.  Few things offer greater return on less investment than praise - offering credit to someone in your organization who has stepped up and done the job.

### Write Your Own Script for Success: Flying by the Seat of Your Pants (Is No Way to Travel)

Having a well-though out plan ready to go in advance of a change in the weather is the key to success.  Making decisions off the top of our heads is a recipe for making bad decisions because we aren't at our best under extreme stress.  We cannot think as clearly or perform as well when engulfed by stress, anxiety, fear, tension, or turmoil.

We must envision the future deeply and in detail, to creatively make the unforseeable foreseeable, and then write our script for the foreseeable.

Knowing what to do under every foreseeable circumstance helps to alleviate anxiety and uncertainty because of the preconceived "game plan."

Scripting provides a prepared, yet flexible method to navigate through turmoil, uncertainty, and stress.

Contigency scripting provides a well-thought-out basis for situational decision making and action; by analzying, planning, and rehearsing in advance you can make a rational decision, the best choice for the situation at hand.  Everything has to be strategized; we have to know where we're going to come out before we go in.  Otherwise we lose.  Scripting and strategizing are simply two different words for fair- and foul-weather leadership.  It brings clarity to confusion situations.

The military is known for doing this - war gaming, thinking through its response to all contingencies.  The more thorough, the more extensive, the more rehearsed, the better you perform under the pressure of any situation that calls for an immediate decision.

Planning for the future shouldn't be postponed until the future arrives.  Scripting allowed Bill Walsh to take randomness and stress out of the decision-making process.  The result was a very adaptable but intelligent plan for the future.

### Control What You Can Control: Let the Score Take Care of Itself

1. Flying by the seat of our pants precedes crashing by the seat of our pants
2. When we prepare for anything, we are ready for anything
3. Create a crisis-management team that is smart enough to anticipate and plan for crises
4. All personall must recognize the organization is adaptive and dynamic in facing unstable "weather"
5. Be resolute in our vision of the future and contingent plans to get where we want to go
6. Our version of "scripting" allows us to respond appropriately in a professional manner; we act like leaders

### The Archaeology of Leadership: Seek Reward in the Ruins

When an organization falls short of a goal, the letdown can be so severe we're blinded to substantive information indicating that success may be closer than we would imagine.

In hindsight, a commonsense mind can parse evidence that offers clues to why things went as they did - both good and bad.  In planning for a successful future, the past can show us how to get there.  Too often we avert our gaze when the past is unpleasant.  We don't want to go there again, even though it contains the road map to a bright future.

### Team Communication Matters

Bill Walsh was smart enough, strong-willed enough, to get rid of talented peope if they were contributors to a negative organizational culture - not team players.

Bill Walsh prized communication and understood that all the knowledge in the world meant little if we cannot communicate effectively.


## Part III: Fundamentals of Leadership: Concepts, Conceits, and Conclusions

Declaring "I am the leader!" has no value unless we also have the command skills necessary to be the leader.

### Common Denominator of Leadership: Strength of Will

The dictatorial type of leadership may result in quick gains, but the cumulative effects of bullying people, creating an environment of ongoing fear, panic, and intimidation, are a situation where employees become increasingly tuned out and immune to all of the leaders noise.

🙁 The "buddy" system: those who aren't "buddies" inevitably begin to feel like second class citizens, which usually leads to the creation of a second-class organization.

🙂 The leader who will not be denied, who has expertise coupled with strength of will, is going to prevail.  They simply would not quit in their effort to install their own system, to push forward with their plan, not someone else's or a committee's.  All successful leaders know where they want to go, figure out a way to get there, and then move forward with absolute determination.  There is an inner compulsion, obsession, to get it done the way they want it done even if the person cost is high.  You may be standing alone.  That is when you find out if you're a leader.  Leaders are paid to make a decsion.  The difference between offering an opinion and making a decision is the difference between working for the leader and being the leader. (Note: there's also a time for a leader to admit when they are wrong.  It is unexcusable to fail because the leader is unwilling to admit their way was the wrong way and that a change of course is their own path to victory)

* A defining characteristic of a good leader is the conviction that he or she can make a positive difference, can prevail even when the odds are stack against him or her.  A successful leader is not easily swayed from this self-belief.
* Sweat the right small stuff, sharp pencils don't translate to sharp performance
  * we cannot be immersed in the meaningless at the expense of the meaningful
  * stupid busywork, "There'll be plenty of time for pencils, parties, and socializing when I lose my job, because that's what's going to happen if I continue to avoid the hard and harsh realities of doing my job."
    * Relieft from high anxieties, deep frustrations, and toxic emotions that go with the job can lead you to do everything *but* your job
* Good leadership percolates down
  * The trademark of a well-led organization is that it's virtually self-sustaining and self-directed, almost autonomous.  If your staff doesn't seem fully mobilized and energized until you enter the room, your leadership has not percolated down.
    * Ultimately, you hope your ideas and way of doing things become so strongly entrenched that the organization performs as effectively without you as with you.
    * This is a reliable indication of an effective leader, namely, one who creates a self-sustaining organization able to operate at the highest levels even when he or she leaves.
    * The responsible leader of any company or organization aggressively seeks to ensure its continued prosperity.  It's the mark of forward-thinking leadership.

### Joe Montana's Leadership

* Never played favorites or believed that a person's reputation, status, or credentials entitled them to special treatment
* Led with his own talent, quiet confidence, and unassuming demeanor
* Didn't have to talk the talk because he walked the walk
* Proved we don't need to shout, stomp, or strut to be a great leader
* Just did the job and treated people right
* Brought out the best in people

### The Leverage of Language

* When attempting to help someone attain that next level of performance, a supportive approach works better than a constantly negative or downside-focused approach.

* If we're growing a garden, we need to pull out the weeds, but flowers will die if *all* we do is pick weeds.  They need sunshine and water.  People are the same.  They need criticism, but they also require positive and substantive language and information and true support to really blossom.

* When your feedback is interpreted as a personal attack rather than a critique with positive intentions, you are going backward.

* Constructive criticism is a powerful instrument essential for improving performance.  Positive support can be equally productive.  Used together by a skilled leader they become the key to maximum results.  Most of us seem to be more inclined to offer the negative.  I don't know why, but it's easier to criticize than to compliment.  Find the right mixture for optimum results.

### Don't Beat Around the Bush (When Describing the Bush)

* Clear communication
* What is expected from employees in a manner that is unambiguous and comprehensive
  * Employees can thrive in an environment where they know *exactly* what is expected of them, even when those expectations are very high.
  * When it comes to telling people what is expected of them, don't be subtle, don't be coy, don't be vague.  What is your version of: "Gentlemen, *this* is football"?

### Communication Creates Collaboration: Big Ears are Better Than Big Egos

* collaboration is required more than ever these days to obtain optimal results
  * only possible in the presence of quality communication
    * free-flowing and robust exchange of information, ideas, and opinions
    * having "big ears" (the skill of being a great listener) is the first law of good communication.
      * The second law is "when you're not listening, ask good questions"
    * communication is not a one-way street, not two-way or three-way; it's an every-way street
      * this is challenging because its easier to tell somebody what to do than to listen to their suggestions and ideas
* an individual doesn't need to be an expert to ask an intelligent question or offer useful insights; however, fear of being shunted aside or told, "That's a stupid question," keeps valid questions from being asked.
  * work with people smart enough to have independent thinking, but strong enough to change their opinion when evidence or logic suggested it.x

### Create Uncertainty

In a highly competitive environment, feeling comfortable is first cousin to being complacent.

### Play with Poise

Leadership requires poise under pressure.  An organization that witnesses its leader at loose ends when troubles arise will look elsewhere for strength and direction.

### Teaching Defines Our Leadership

> I came to understand over my years as an assistance coach that when the audience is bored, its not their fault.  And when they're plugged in and excited, it's because of you, the person in charge.

#### 1. Passion is not just having a desire to do the job of teaching.
* Being consumed with the process of developing the abilities of others is a fundamental source of personal joy.

#### 2. Expertise is the inventory of knowledge and experience we possess on a particular subject.
* we will not be followed when we are not as knowledgeable in what we do as we should be
* a teacher gains expertise by seeking out great teachers, mentors, and other sources of information and wisdom in a relentless effort to add to his or her own knowledge.
* actively seeking the counsel of those we repect  in our profession, as well as studing printed material and publications that we determine will provide pertinent input.

#### 3. Communication is the ability to organize and then successfully convey our informed thoughts.
* facial and body language
* moving assuredly with energy

⭐️ Companies led by good teachers, those with passion, expertise, communication skills, and persistence, do very well.
